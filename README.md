# Blabber: A Twitter Clone

MiniURL is a basic clone of [Twitter, now known as X](https://www.twitter.com). Twitter is a social media service that provides users a platform to post short-form messages ("tweets") to feeds that other users can follow. Twitter also allows for including links to external platforms, posting media, and searching for users and posts.

This project was done in part to practice concepts in system design and full-stack development.

More details to come soon.
